# SoccerLeagueAndroidApp
Cegep GIM has recently created a soccer league for its students . A mobile application is needed to easily manage the league . The application will be used to manage the teams and players that participate in the league , to create the schedule of matches , to enter the result of the matches and to display various standings and statistics . Three types of users can use the application : league managers , team managers and guests . Guests do not need to login , and can view the contents of the application , but not modify them . League managers and team managers must login to use the application . Team managers can manage one and only one team , and a team can have one and only one manager . Team managers can edit the team ' s information ( name , colors , contact information of manager ) as well as add and remove players from the team . League managers have the same rights as team managers , but they have access to all teams . League managers can create and delete teams . League managers can create seasons , and create schedules for seasons . They can enter / modify results of matches
